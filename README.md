# Palindrome Checker Using List

This Python program allows users to input multiple words and checks whether each word is a palindrome. It then categorizes the words into two lists: one for palindromes and one for non-palindromes.

## Features
- The program prompts the user to enter the number of words they want to check.
- It accepts multiple words as input and checks if each word is a palindrome.
- The words are categorized into two lists: palindromes and non-palindromes.
- The results are displayed for both categories.

## How to Use
1. Run the script.
2. Input the number of words you want to check.
3. Enter each word when prompted.
4. The program will output two lists: one containing palindromes and the other containing non-palindromes.

### Example Usage:
```bash
How many words would you like to check for palindrome? input a number: 3
Enter word 3: madam
Enter word 2: racecar
Enter word 1: hello

These are the palindromes
['madam', 'racecar']
These are not palindromes
['hello']
